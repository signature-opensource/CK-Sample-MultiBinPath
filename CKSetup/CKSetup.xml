<!-- The root element name can be named differently but what is important is the Engine attribute. 
     This Engine attribute is fundamental: it is the complete type of the object that will be instantiated and 
     executed by the Runner. It can be any class that looks like this:

    public class Engine
    {
        public Engine( IActivityMonitor m, XElement config ) { }

        public bool Run() => true;
    }

    Here are the pure CKSetup configurations: BasePath, WorkingDirectory, CKSetupName, LogLevel, UseSignatureFiles, ExternalSignature, PreferredTargetRuntimes and  Dependencies.
    The BinPaths element is shared between the Engine and CKSetup. CKSetup is only concerned by the path itself but the StObjEngine needs to configure these paths
    with more information like "Types" or "ExcludedTypes".
  -->

  <!-- This is the base path that applies to all relative paths that mat appear in this file.
       When this BasePath is undefined or empty (the default), it is the path of this configuration file itself that is used: 
       by default any relative path in this file are relative to this file's folder.

  <!-- If you don't specify this WorkingDirectory, a timed folder is created under %Temp%/CKSetup folder. But keeping an eye on it is a good idea.
       By default: 
        - CKSetup.log file in this directory contains the logs with the Log Level specified here (set the attribute HasLogs="false" to skip producing the logs).
        - Old (ie. previous) timed folders are automatically cleaned up (set the attribute KeepOnlyCount="X" where X is not 5 to change number of previous run to keep). -->

  <!-- By default, CKSetup calculates a binary signature (SHA1) of all files participanting in a setup and saves it in CKSetup.signature.txt files after execution in each BinPath.

       To suppress this behavior, specify False instead of True:
      
  <UseSignatureFiles>True</UseSignatureFiles>.

  <!-- Optional element that allows you to specify a list of runtimes in descending order of preference (separated by ; like TargetFrameworks in a csproj).
       In the absence of this element, the "smallest/oldest" runtime is selected.
       For example, on BinPaths that contain only NetStandard2.0 assemblies (pure "Model" assemblies), Net461 will be selected.
       Note that CKSetup.Runner supports 3 versions: Net461, NetCoreApp2.1 and NetCoreApp3.1.

       Here, since we are targeting netstandard2.0 folders, the default selected runtime is... Net461. This is NOT what we want :). 
  -->
  <PreferredTargetRuntimes>NetCoreApp31</PreferredTargetRuntimes>


  <!-- Optional Dependencies element allows to inject any setup dependencies or increase the (minimal) version of a discovered setup dependencies.

       Example:

          <Dependencies>
            <Dependency Name="Another.Component" MinVersion="1.0.2-ci-develop.15" />
            <Dependency Name="Component.In.Whatever.Version" />
            <Dependency Name="CKSetup.Runner" MinVersion="5.0.0-d06-00-develop-0016" />
          </Dependencies>

       The case of the CKSetup.Runner dependency is special in that, if it does not appear, it is automatically added with the version of the CKSetup tool itself.
       It is therefore possible to use an "old runner" (which is done in the above example), or a "newer runner".
       For all the other dependencies, the resolution mechanism applies: the maximum of the the different MinVersion will be used.
